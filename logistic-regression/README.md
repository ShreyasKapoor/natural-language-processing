# Logistic Regression

Logestic Regression is one of the fundamental algorithm of NLP that is mainly used to classify the output result in one of the category. In this example, we'll be having hotel reviews as examples for training data and will then test some more reviews to tell them if they are a positive feedback of a negative feedback. 

## Data

The Data consistes of two different files - positive reviews and negative reviews. Each file consistes of about 95 reviews. We will furthen randomly select the reviews for training and testing in 80:20 ratio. 

## Conversion of data into vectors. 

The data will first be needed to convert into vectors. we'll use the feature Matrix to convert english language into their mathematical representation. This is done according to the rules given into the feature matrix.
